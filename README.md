# RNN based LSTM model for Time Series Demand forecasting

In this project, RNN based LSTM deep learning model is used to predict future car sales

We trained a Neural Networks to predict future sales and demand using Recurrent Neural Networks based Long Short-Term memory (LSTM). We varied the number of hidden 
layers, and the training time by using different epochs. In all, we trained 7 Neural Networks and selected the best one to predict future sales.

RNN â€“ Recurrent Neural Network is a Deep Learning algorithm. There are 3 major categories of Deep learning and neural network (ANN, CNN, and RNN) out of which RNN 
is one such model in which a feedback loop is introduced in an algorithm so that the model keeps on learning with each time steps. Whatever the hidden layer is processing, it sends it to the output and it also sends it back to itself so the concept of Time steps is introduced. Therefore RNN is very useful in problems where we have History and sequential Data.

LSTM - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies. The long-term reliance problem is addressed with LSTMs. It is 
their natural tendency to remember knowledge for extended periods of time.
